    <!-- The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
    The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
    The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
    Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! -->
    
    <!-- A tag <div> cria um bloco genérico para agrupar conteúdos. Ela é equivalente, no grupo de tags de bloco, ao que a tag <span> representa no grupo de
        tags inline/conteúdo. A função da tag <div> é separar os conteúdos do código HTML em divisões de espaço/conjunto, sem qualquer peso semântico. -->

              This is used to add extra information to the web page so that it can be relevant and more specifically searched by the search engines.  -->
            

            <!-- 1. How to mark up your content using microdata
1a. Why use microdata?
Your web pages have an underlying meaning that people understand when they read the web pages. 
But search engines have a limited understanding of what is being discussed on those pages. By adding additional tags to the HTML of your web pages—tags that say,
"Hey search engine, this information describes this specific movie, or place, or person, or video"—you can help search engines and other applications better understand 
your content and display it in a useful, relevant way. Microdata is a set of tags, introduced with HTML5, that allows you to do this.

1b. itemscope and itemtype
Let's start with a concrete example. Imagine you have a page about the movie Avatar—a page with a link to a movie trailer, information about the director, and so on. 
Your HTML code might look something like this:

<div>
 <h1>Avatar</h1>
 <span>Director: James Cameron (born August 16, 1954)</span>
 <span>Science fiction</span>
 <a href="../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html">Trailer</a>
</div>

To begin, identify the section of the page that is "about" the movie Avatar. 
To do this, add the itemscope element to the HTML tag that encloses information about the item, like this:

<div itemscope>
  <h1>Avatar</h1>
  <span>Director: James Cameron (born August 16, 1954) </span>
  <span>Science fiction</span>
  <a href="../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html">Trailer</a>
</div>

By adding itemscope, you are specifying that the HTML contained in the <div>...</div> block is about a particular item.

But it's not all that helpful to specify that there is an item being discussed without specifying what kind of an item it is. 
You can specify the type of item using the itemtype attribute immediately after the itemscope.

<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Movie">
  <h1>Avatar</h1>
  <span>Director: James Cameron (born August 16, 1954)</span>
  <span>Science fiction</span>
  <a href="../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html">Trailer</a>
</div>
This specifies that the item contained in the div is in fact a Movie, as defined in the schema.org type hierarchy. 
Item types are provided as URLs, in this case https://schema.org/Movie.


1c. itemprop
What additional information can we give search engines about the movie Avatar? Movies have interesting properties such as actors, director, ratings. 
To label properties of an item, use the itemprop attribute. For example, to identify the director of a movie, add itemprop="director" to the element 
enclosing the director's name. (There's a full list of all the properties you can associate with a movie at https://schema.org/Movie.)

<div itemscope itemtype ="https://schema.org/Movie">
  <h1 itemprop="name">Avatar</h1>
  <span>Director: <span itemprop="director">James Cameron</span> (born August 16, 1954)</span>
  <span itemprop="genre">Science fiction</span>
  <a href="../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html" itemprop="trailer">Trailer</a>
</div>

Note that we have added additional <span>...</span> tags to attach the itemprop attributes to the appropriate text on the page.
<span> tags don't change the way pages are rendered by a web browser, so they are a convenient HTML element to use with itemprop.

Search engines can now understand not just that http://www.avatarmovie.com is a URL, but also that it's the URL for the trailer for the science-fiction movie Avatar,
 which was directed by James Cameron. -->


Example 2:
In this example, the search engines can understand that given div has a URL that contains “Information” about a film named “Avengers”
which is of genre “Action” and is directed by “Russo Brothers”.

    <div itemscope itemtype=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film">
        <h1 itemprop="name">Avengers</h1>
        <br>
        <span>Directors : 
            <span itemprop="Directors">
              Russo Brothers
            </span>
        </span> 
        <br>
        <span>Genre :
            <span itemprop="genre"> 
              Action 
            </span>
          </span>
        <br>
        <a itemprop="Information" 
           href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)">
            Information 
        </a>
    </div>

<br>


            <h1 itemprop="name ">
                A star is born
            </h1>
            <p itemprop="abstract">
                A musicina helps a young singer find fame as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral.
            </p>
            <div itemprop="image">

            </div>
            <footer itemprop="director" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
